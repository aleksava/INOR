Oooh
we're
no
strangers
to
love
you
know
the
rules
and
so
do
I
a
full
commitment's
is
what
I'm
thinking
of
you
wouldn't
get
this
from
any
other
guy
I
just
wanna
tell
you
how
I'm
feeling
gotta
make
you
understand
never
gonna
give
you
up
never
gonna
let
you
down
never
gonna
run
around
and
desert
you
never
gonna
make
you
cry
never
gonna
say
goodbye
never
tell
a
lie
and
hurt
you
we've
known
eachother
for
so
long
your
heart's
been
aching
but
you're
too
shy
to
say
it
Inside
we
both
know
what's
been
going
on
we
know
the
game
and
we're
gonna
play
it
and
if
you
ask
me
how
I'm
feeling
don't
tell
me
you're
too
blind
to
see
never
gonna
give
you
up
never
gonna
let
you
down
never
gonna
run
around
and
desert
you
never
gonna
make
you
cry
never
gonna
say
goodbye
never
tell
a
lie
and
hurt
you
